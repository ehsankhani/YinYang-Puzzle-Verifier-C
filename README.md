# YinYang-Puzzle-Verifier-C
This C program verifies the adherence of a 4x4 binary matrix to Yin Yang puzzle rules. It converts a decimal input to its binary representation, splits it into sets representing emptiness and color, creates a matrix following a specific order, and checks the matrix against predefined rules to determine if it qualifies as a Yin Yang puzzle solution.
